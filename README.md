### Inspiration
Most social-media platforms support product endorsement by displaying advertisements on behalf of certified sellers. These advertisements lack target-audience knowledge and have limited area of creativity for the sellers. Such generic ads have a low probability of reaching the right audience.

**TLDR**; there are two main areas in tailored discovery to improve ad success:

- Recommend specifc products to users based on user data
- Allowing seller to choose an influencer for advertisement.
***
### What it does
Our tailored discovery system is a two part AI service, where 
1. **`Knowledge Graphs`** helps sellers by endorsing their product in the form of a personalized advertizement, specifically to a users who are more likely to buy their products based on their activity/interactions on Tiktok.
2. **`GenAI`** helps sellers to choose an influencer whose digital footprints are utilized to generate a personalized ad video, in a controlled manner.
